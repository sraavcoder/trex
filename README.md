# trex
i have found 2 bugs: 1. the restart sprite was being  appeared below the clouds, 2.the highest score was not displayed. i have debuged them in this way: 1.to debug the first one i increased the depth of restart sprite by 2, 2. to debug the second one i have checked weather the highscore is working or not and it was working fine then i have texted the highscore just above the score.
